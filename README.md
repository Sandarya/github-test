How to Do Well in QC Sessions
Performing well in technical interviews, including QC, requires confidently answering both
high-level conceptual questions on specific technologies as well as low-level details about how
you’ve worked with them.
For example, as a developer you’ve most likely worked with git before. A common interview
question to test your proficiency might be “Tell me about your experience working with git”. How
would you answer this? Take a minute to think about it and then consider the sample responses
below. Which answer would impress you more as an interviewer? Which one demonstrates an
understanding and proficiency with the tool better?
Response 1
“Well, uh , for git uh I think I’ve used it on a few projects for pushing code… it’s really helpful ,
pretty easy to work with, it lets me keep track of stuff going on in the project and work with
other people well.”
Response 2
“So I’ve used git for almost all of my projects. It’s a really useful distributed version control
system for managing source code - I’ve used it on the command line to add, commit, and
push code to an online repository , usually GitHub , as well as switch between different feature
branches that my team members and I work on. I like it because it smooths the process of
collaborating on the same codebase and merging or integrating changes .”
Note a few problems in the first response: the use of filler words (“ummm”, “ahh”) - you should
remove these as much as possible. Don’t lower your voice and trail off at the end of sentences,
it implies uncertainty. Also note the vague words that are bolded - it doesn’t answer how git is
helpful, how it is easy to work with, or how it lets you keep track of “stuff” (whatever that is).
Finally, the only technical word mentioned is “pushing” code.
In contrast, the second answer is well-structured and smooth, and it drops in several technical
keywords that demonstrates knowledge in the domain - it explains what (“distributed version
control”), how (“add, commit, push code”), and why (“smoothing the process of collaborating”).
Putting these together, it sounds like the person giving the second answer has worked
in-depth with git.
Review one more high-level sample question and answer below.
Q: “Tell me about the Spring framework”
A: “The Spring framework is a Java framework for production-ready enterprise applications
based on the concept of inversion of control - there is an IOC container which manages the
lifecycle of your application beans , provided either through XML, Java, or annotation
configuration . We can achieve loose coupling of our code by letting Spring inject our bean
dependencies directly into our classes.”
Remember, there are 3 key questions you should ask for every technology you learn about -
what is it and what does it do, how does it work, and why is it useful?
As you go through training, think about this approach for structuring your responses in QC,
one-on-ones, and panels.
Pre-Cumulative QC Exercise
Pick any 4 technologies you’ve worked with in training. Use the spaces below to write out your
responses to the question “Tell me about your experience with X” where X is the technology.
Bold the important keywords in your responses.
1. ______________________________________________________________________
______________________________________________________________________

2. ______________________________________________________________________

4. ______________________________________________________________________

Now, review this, revise it, ask your teammates to review it and give their feedback, and
then finalize your answers. You should practice saying these answers so that it comes
naturally to you when you are asked these questions in interviews.
